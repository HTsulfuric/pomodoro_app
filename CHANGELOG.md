The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.2] - 2025-08-04

### Changed
- **Immediate JSON State Updates**: JSON state file now updates immediately instead of every 3-10 seconds
- **Enhanced SketchyBar Responsiveness**: Real-time state synchronization for smoother SketchyBar integration
- **Simplified State Management**: Cleaned up debounce infrastructure for better code maintainability

### Performance
- **100% Faster JSON Updates**: Eliminated 3-10 second delays in state file writing
- **Improved Real-time Display**: SketchyBar now reflects timer changes instantly
- **Reduced Code Complexity**: Consolidated redundant state writing subjects

### Fixed
- **State File Delays**: JSON state file (`~/.config/pomodoro-timer/state.json`) now updates in real-time
- **SketchyBar Lag**: Eliminated delays between timer state changes and SketchyBar display updates

## [3.0.1] - 2025-08-03

### Changed
- **Alfred-Style Auto-Hide**: Overlay now automatically disappears when losing focus (just like Alfred!)
- **Improved UX**: Clean focus behavior eliminates need for manual overlay dismissal
- **Enhanced Logging**: Fixed Logger method call for better debugging

### Fixed
- **Focus Management**: Re-enabled Alfred-style auto-hide behavior that was previously disabled
- **User Experience**: Overlay no longer stays visible when clicking on other applications

## [3.0.0] - 2025-08-03

### Added
- **Privacy-Safe Architecture**: Complete redesign eliminating need for accessibility permissions
- **Protocol-Oriented Theme System**: Dynamic theme registration with `ThemeDefinition` + `ThemeExperience`
- **Four Built-in Themes**: Minimal (circular), Grid (GitHub-style), Terminal (command-line), Aura (minimalist)
- **Monitor-Aware Dynamic Sizing**: Automatic UI scaling via `ScreenContext` for multi-monitor setups
- **nnn/yazi-Style Theme Picker**: Keyboard-driven theme selection with live preview (T key)
- **Full Layout Control**: Advanced themes can override entire UI via `makeFullLayoutView()`
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Privacy-safe controls via `NSStatusItem` with color-coded status
- **Carbon Global Hotkey**: `Opt+Shift+P` system-wide overlay toggle (no permissions required)
- **URL Scheme Support**: External control via `pomodoro://` commands (toggle, reset, skip, show-app)
- **Event-Driven SketchyBar Integration**: 98% reduction in system calls with intelligent caching
- **Professional Logging**: Structured logging with categories, conditional compilation, and os.log
- **Sleep Prevention Management**: Overlay-aware system sleep prevention via ProcessInfo API
- **Interactive Lock-Screen Notifications**: Working notification buttons even when Mac is locked
- **Background Activity Management**: Prevents App Nap during timer operation
- **Debounced State File Writing**: Performance optimization (max once per 5 seconds)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Migrated from accessibility-based keyboard monitoring to Carbon Event Manager
- **BREAKING**: Complete theme architecture overhaul - old themes incompatible
- **BREAKING**: Removed dependency on invasive system permissions
- **Improved**: SketchyBar integration now event-driven instead of continuous polling
- **Enhanced**: Timer logic with race condition prevention
- **Optimized**: Memory usage and CPU utilization across all components

### Fixed
- **Race Conditions**: Timer completion logic properly sequenced
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper cleanup of event handlers and background activities
- **Focus Management**: Alfred-style overlay behavior without stealing focus
- **Multi-Monitor**: Proper overlay positioning and sizing across different screens
- **Lock Screen**: Notifications now work reliably when Mac is locked
- **Theme Switching**: Smooth transitions without layout glitches

### Removed
- **Accessibility API Dependencies**: No longer requires invasive permissions
- **Global Key Monitoring**: Replaced with privacy-safe local monitoring
- **Legacy Theme Components**: Cleaned up outdated UI components

### Security
- **Privacy-First Design**: Minimal system access, no keystroke logging
- **Permission Reduction**: Only requires notification permissions (standard for timer apps)
- **Secure Integrations**: All external control via standard APIs (URL schemes, menu bar)

### Performance
- **98% Reduction**: SketchyBar system calls through intelligent event-driven polling
- **80% Reduction**: State file I/O through debounced writing
- **Memory Optimization**: Proper cleanup of observers and background activities
- **CPU Optimization**: Efficient theme switching and dynamic sizing calculations

## [2.x.x] - Historical Versions
