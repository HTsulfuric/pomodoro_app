- **Memory Optimization**: Eliminated SwiftUI memory allocation churn through proper state management
- **CPU Efficiency**: Reduced expensive font calculations with intelligent caching
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent queue implementation for theme registry operations

### Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive protection against command injection in SketchyBar integration

## [3.0.2] - 2025-08-04

### Changed
- **Immediate JSON State Updates**: JSON state file now updates immediately instead of every 3-10 seconds
- **Enhanced SketchyBar Responsiveness**: Real-time state synchronization for smoother SketchyBar integration
- **Simplified State Management**: Cleaned up debounce infrastructure for better code maintainability

### Performance
- **100% Faster JSON Updates**: Eliminated 3-10 second delays in state file writing
- **Improved Real-time Display**: SketchyBar now reflects timer changes instantly
- **Reduced Code Complexity**: Consolidated redundant state writing subjects

### Fixed
- **State File Delays**: JSON state file (`~/.config/pomodoro-timer/state.json`) now updates in real-time
- **SketchyBar Lag**: Eliminated delays between timer state changes and SketchyBar display updates

## [3.0.1] - 2025-08-03

### Changed
- **Alfred-Style Auto-Hide**: Overlay now automatically disappears when losing focus (just like Alfred!)
- **Improved UX**: Clean focus behavior eliminates need for manual overlay dismissal
- **Enhanced Logging**: Fixed Logger method call for better debugging

### Fixed
- **Focus Management**: Re-enabled Alfred-style auto-hide behavior that was previously disabled
- **User Experience**: Overlay no longer stays visible when clicking on other applications

## [3.0.0] - 2025-08-03
